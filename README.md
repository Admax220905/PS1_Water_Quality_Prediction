# Water Quality Prediction for Concrete Mixing 🌊💧

## Overview 📊
This repository contains an exciting machine learning project to predict water quality! 🎉 We calculate the Water Quality Index (WQI) and assess water quality status using key parameters, making water monitoring smarter and more effective! 🌱

## Features ✨
- Data cleaning and engaging exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore water quality parameters! 📊
- Precise calculation of the Water Quality Index (WQI) from raw data. ✅
- Training of multiple machine learning models for accurate predictions! 🤖
- In-depth analysis of water quality status based on predicted WQI. 📈

## Methodology 🔧
- **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the dataset, including `Data.csv`, to handle missing values and inconsistencies. 🧹
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Create insightful visualizations and stats to uncover parameter relationships using `Data.csv`! 📉
- **Model Development**: Train three machine learning models to predict WQI and water quality status. 🛠️
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance for precision and reliability! ✔️

## REQUIREMENTS 📋
**Important: Data.csv** is required for this project.
